# Scripting {{{
# A list of directories that the role should create and that should be
# accessible by the OpenVPN server to write into after it has dropped
# privileges. The OpenVPN server should run with limited privileges, e.g. with
# `openvpn_user` set to `nobody`. Such a user will not be able to access many
# files and directories in the file system. This means that if you want one of
# your scripts to write to some file (e.g. under `/var/log`), that file will
# need to be writable by the OpenVPN server. The directories included in this
# variable will be created by the role with permissions that will allow the
# OpenVPN server to write into them, thus your scripts will be able to create
# and write to files inside them. Example: [`/var/log/openvpn-script-out/`].

# The scripts will be uploaded under `openvpn_scripts_dir`. You can reference
# them in `openvpn_server_options` for the OpenVPN configuration option you
# want. The files can be templates. The role comes with an example script (under
# `templates/scripts/client-disconnect.sh.j2`) that will log client
# disconnections. Eg:
# ```
# openvpn_script_files:
#   - "scripts/client-disconnect.sh.j2"

# ```
openvpn_script_files: []

#       #!/usr/bin/env
#       echo 'Up!' >> "{{ openvpn_script_output_directories[0] }}/up.log"
# ```
openvpn_inline_scripts: []

# NOTE The role also comes with `up` and `down` scripts that are used if you
# enable bridge configuration (see `openvpn_bridge`). These are handled by the
# bridge-specific tasks.
